### The Shift in Corporate Gifting

The corporate gifting market is experiencing a major transformation. Generic, low-quality "swag" is being replaced by thoughtful, personalized, and high-quality gifts that build genuine relationships. Companies are increasingly using gifts as a strategic tool to show appreciation, boost morale, and reinforce brand values.

### Key Market Trends for 2025

## Section 4: Business & Marketing Strategy

### Pricing Strategy

A hybrid approach is best:

1.  **Cost-Plus Pricing (Your Floor):** Calculate your total cost per item (materials, labor, overhead). This is your break-even point.
2.  **Value-Based Pricing (Your Ceiling):** Price based on the high perceived value of a handmade, personalized item. Don't compete with mass-produced swag.
3.  **Tiered/Volume Discounts (The Corporate Hook):** Create a pricing sheet with clear tiers. For example:
    *   1-25 Units: Full Price
    *   26-100 Units: 10% Discount
    *   101-500 Units: 15% Discount
    *   500+ Units: Custom Quote

### Marketing & Sales Channels

*   **Etsy:** A great starting point to test products and gain initial customers. Use high-quality photography.
*   **Direct Outreach:** Create a professional portfolio (a simple website or PDF). Reach out directly to HR and Marketing managers at your target companies via LinkedIn or email.
*   **Local B2B Networking:** Join local business associations or chambers of commerce. Attend networking events with samples.
*   **Instagram/Pinterest:** Use these visual platforms to showcase your beautiful products, the making-of process, and custom branding examples.
