## Topic 2: DIY Corporate Gifts Business

### **Script D: The End of the Boring Corporate Gift**

**Concept:** A classic "problem-agitate-solution" marketing video to attract business clients.
**Style:** Professional, cinematic, and persuasive.

**[SCENE]:** A stylized, slow-motion shot of a generic gift basket filled with cellophane and cheap crackers being placed on an office desk. The employee looks at it with a forced, polite smile.

**[AUDIO]:** Muted, generic corporate background music.

**[NARRATOR]:** You want to show your team you appreciate them. But does another generic gift basket really say "we value you"?

**[SCENE]:** A montage of forgettable corporate gifts: a cheap pen with a logo, a flimsy tote bag, a standard coffee mug. Employees look indifferent.

**[AUDIO]:** The sound of a sad trombone plays softly.

**[NARRATOR]:** These gifts say "obligation." They're impersonal. They end up in the back of a closet. What if a gift could do more? What if it could build your team up?

**[SCENE]:** The screen cuts to black. Then, a beautifully shot, warm scene of a team gathered around a table. They are laughing and working together on a DIY project - perhaps assembling a small terrarium or a custom leather good from a kit.

**[AUDIO]:** The music shifts to a warm, authentic, acoustic track. The sounds of genuine laughter and conversation.

**[NARRATOR]:** Introducing a new direction in corporate gifting. We provide hands-on, creative experiences in a box.

**[SCENE]:** Close-ups of the high-quality materials in the DIY kit: rich leather, beautiful glassware, premium tools. The company's logo is subtly and tastefully debossed on the packaging.

**[NARRATOR]:** Instead of just giving a gift, you give an opportunity: to create, to connect, and to de-stress. It’s a team-building exercise and a premium gift, all in one.

**[SCENE]:** A final shot of an employee placing their finished DIY creation on their desk. It looks fantastic and personal. They touch it and smile, a genuine smile this time.

**[AUDIO]:** Music swells and fades.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** Stop giving stuff. Start giving experiences. [Your Business Name/Website]

### **Script E: The Unboxing**

**Concept:** A video from the point of view of an employee receiving and unboxing one of your DIY kits.
**Style:** First-person, authentic, "unboxing" trend.

**[SCENE]:** A first-person view. Hands are holding a beautifully designed, minimalist box. The company's logo is visible but elegant.

**[AUDIO]:** The sound of tearing paper, the box opening. Curious, gentle music.

**[NARRATOR (Internal Monologue)]:** Okay, another gift from corporate. Let's see what we've got this year...

**[SCENE]:** The hands lift the lid. Inside, instead of plastic wrap, there's neatly arranged tissue paper with a wax seal. The hands break the seal.

**[NARRATOR]:** Whoa. Okay, this is different.

**[SCENE]:** The hands lift out the items one by one. A piece of high-quality, fragrant leather. A small, heavy metal tool. A little bottle of oil. A card with simple, elegant instructions.

**[AUDIO]:** Music becomes more intrigued and positive. The sound of the quality materials is emphasized (the thud of the tool, the crinkle of the leather).

**[NARRATOR]:** Is this... a kit? To make my own... passport holder? No way. The leather feels amazing.

**[SCENE]:** A time-lapse from the same first-person view. The hands are now following the instructions, punching holes, threading a needle. The process looks engaging and satisfying, not difficult.

**[NARRATOR]:** I actually forgot about work for a half-hour. Just focused on this. It was... calming.

**[SCENE]:** The final product is held up to the camera. A beautiful, handmade leather passport holder. It looks professional and unique.

**[NARRATOR]:** And I *made* this. My company didn't just give me another mug. They gave me a chance to make something cool. I feel... actually appreciated.

**[AUDIO]:** Music ends on a warm, resonant note.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** The gift that shows you actually care. [Your Business Name/Website]

### **Script F: 3 Reasons Your Team Needs a DIY Experience**

**Concept:** A direct, informative "listicle" video for HR managers and team leads.
**Style:** Clean, corporate, with animated text and icons.

**[SCENE]:** Opens with a clean, animated title.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** 3 Reasons a DIY Gift is Better Than a Gift Card.

**[AUDIO]:** Crisp, professional, but friendly corporate music.

**[NARRATOR]:** Looking for a corporate gift that actually makes an impact? Here are three reasons a hands-on DIY experience is your best investment.

**[SCENE]:** An animated number "1" appears on screen, next to an icon of a brain with gears turning.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** 1. It Boosts Engagement & Fights Burnout

**[NARRATOR]:** One. It boosts engagement and fights burnout. Staring at a screen all day is draining. A tactile, hands-on activity like working with leather or wood uses a different part of the brain. It's a proven way to reduce stress and refresh your team's focus.

**[SCENE]:** An animated number "2" appears, next to an icon of two people shaking hands.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** 2. It Creates Genuine Connection

**[NARRATOR]:** Two. It creates genuine connection. A five-dollar coffee is forgotten in minutes. But when your team builds something together, even remotely, they share a memorable experience. It sparks conversation and builds camaraderie far more effectively than a happy hour.

**[SCENE]:** An animated number "3" appears, next to an icon of a trophy.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** 3. It Delivers a Lasting Sense of Accomplishment

**[NARRATOR]:** And three. It delivers a lasting sense of accomplishment. At the end, your employee doesn't just have a gift; they have a trophy. A beautiful, high-quality item they made with their own hands. It's a permanent, positive reminder of their skill and your company's investment in their well-being.

**[SCENE]:** The three points appear on screen together. The video ends on your company's logo and contact information.

**[AUDIO]:** Music concludes with a final, positive sound.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** Ready to give a better gift? [Your Business Name/Website]
