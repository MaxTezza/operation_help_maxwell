## Desk & Office Accessories

1.  **Custom-Branded Leather Coasters:**
    *   **Why:** Leather feels premium. You can easily stamp or laser-engrave a company's logo for a sophisticated and durable gift.

2.  **Handmade Concrete Desk Organizers:**
    *   **Why:** A matching set (pen holder, phone stand, card holder) has a modern, minimalist appeal. You can create custom molds and even tint the concrete to match brand colors.

3.  **Personalized Wooden Phone/Tablet Stand:**

4.  **Branded Leather Cord Organizers:**
    *   **Why:** A small, inexpensive, yet highly effective gift. A simple leather snap or wrap that keeps cables tidy is something everyone needs. Easy to produce in bulk and stamp with a logo.

5.  **Custom-Poured Scented Candles:**
    *   **Why:** You can create unique "signature scents" for a company. The vessel and label are fully brandable, making it a powerful sensory marketing tool.

6.  **Hand-Bound Leather or Wood Journals:**
    *   **Why:** A high-quality, refillable journal feels much more personal than a mass-produced one. You can offer logo embossing on the cover.

7.  **Laser-Engraved Slate or Wood Desk Plaque:**
    *   **Why:** A modern alternative to the traditional nameplate. Can be engraved with a company logo, a motivational quote, or an employee's name.
