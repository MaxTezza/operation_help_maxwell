### **Part 1: Wall Printing**

Wall printing is a rapidly growing industry that uses specialized vertical printers to apply high-resolution images directly onto interior and exterior walls.

**1.1. Inks Used & Manufacturers**

*   **Primary Ink Type: UV-Curable Ink.** This is the industry standard. It is a liquid polymer that is instantly cured (hardened) by ultraviolet (UV) lamps attached to the printhead.
    *   **Advantages:** Highly durable, scratch-resistant, water-resistant, and can adhere to a vast range of surfaces including drywall, plaster, brick, concrete, wood, glass, and metal.
    *   **Longevity:** Prints can last 8-10+ years indoors and 2-5 years outdoors.
    *   **Manufacturers:** Most machine manufacturers (like The Wall Printer, MaxWave, etc.) produce and sell their own branded UV inks, which are specifically formulated for their machines. It is strongly recommended to use the manufacturer-approved ink to ensure printhead longevity and print quality.
*   **Secondary Ink Type: Water-Based CMYK Ink.** This is a less common and less durable option.
    *   **Use Case:** Best for absorbent, smooth surfaces like primed drywall or canvas.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Longer drying time, less durable, and not suitable for non-porous or outdoor surfaces.

**1.2. Machine Manufacturers & Differences**

### **Part 2: Floor Printing**

Floor printing is a niche but growing field that uses technology almost identical to wall printing but oriented to print on horizontal surfaces. Many machines are sold as "2-in-1" wall and floor printers.

**2.1. Inks, Machines, and Software**

*   **Inks:** The technology exclusively uses **UV-Curable Ink** for durability and its ability to adhere to floor surfaces like concrete, epoxy, wood, and asphalt.
*   **Machine Manufacturers:** The manufacturers are largely the same as for wall printing (**MaxWave, DXonJet, TANYU, Perfect Laser, etc.**). The primary difference in a floor printer is its chassis, which is designed to roll along the ground.
*   **Machine Differences:** The key distinguishing feature is the use of **advanced sensors (ultrasonic or laser)** that constantly measure the distance to the floor, allowing the printhead to automatically adjust to uneven surfaces and maintain consistent print quality.
*   **Software:** The software (both RIP and Control) is also the same as for wall printers. A critical feature for floor printing is **image stitching**, which allows the printer to create massive, seamless images by printing in sections.

**2.2. Costs & Startup Investment**

*   **Machine Cost:**
    *   **Mid-Range:** $4,000 - $12,000.

### **Part 3: 3D Printing on Fabric**

This is a branch of additive manufacturing focused on creating textiles from scratch or printing 3D designs directly onto existing fabrics. It is a more nascent technology than wall/floor printing, with applications ranging from high fashion to functional sportswear and medical textiles.

**3.1. Resins (Filaments) & Manufacturers**

The material used is a solid thermoplastic filament that is melted and extruded.

*   **Primary Material: Flexible Filaments.**
    *   **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane):** The most popular choice. It is highly flexible, durable, and bonds well with many fabrics. **NinjaTek** is a leading manufacturer of high-quality flexible filaments (their "NinjaFlex" and "Cheetah" lines are industry standards).
    *   **TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer):** Another category of flexible filaments.
*   **Secondary Material: Rigid Filaments.**
    *   **PLA (Polylactic Acid):** A biodegradable and easy-to-print plastic, but it is rigid and can have trouble adhering to fabric.
    *   **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol):** More durable than PLA.
*   **Material Manufacturers:** Besides **NinjaTek**, many 3D printer and material companies like **Stratasys, 3D Systems, and Polymaker** produce these filaments.

**3.2. Machine Manufacturers & Differences**

The machines are 3D printers, not inkjet printers.

*   **Technology Types:**
    *   **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling):** The most common and affordable method. It involves melting a filament and depositing it layer by layer. Most desktop 3D printers use this technology.
    *   **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering):** A more industrial process that uses a laser to fuse powdered material (like TPU powder) together. It produces highly flexible and durable parts.
    *   **PolyJet/Material Jetting:** An industrial process (led by **Stratasys**) that jets liquid photopolymers onto a surface and cures them with UV light. This allows for multi-material and multi-color printing directly on fabric.
*   **Machine Manufacturers:**
    *   **Industrial:** **Stratasys** (with its J-series and 3DFashion technology) and **3D Systems** are leaders in industrial applications. **Sinterit** is a key player for SLS machines.
    *   **Desktop/Prosumer:** Any well-calibrated FDM printer can be used. Brands like **Prusa, Creality, and WASP** are popular choices for designers and small businesses. The key is the ability to handle flexible filaments.

**3.3. Software & Manufacturers**

The software workflow is different from 2D printing.

*   **3D Modeling/CAD Software:** This is where the 3D object is designed.
    *   **Professional Fashion Design:** **CLO 3D** and **Browzwear** are industry standards for virtual garment design and simulation. **Optitex** is another major player.
    *   **General CAD:** **Autodesk Fusion 360**, **Blender** (free), and **SolidWorks** are used to create the 3D models.
*   **Slicer Software:** This software "slices" the 3D model into hundreds or thousands of layers and generates the G-code (the instructions) for the 3D printer.
    *   **Examples:** **Ultimaker Cura** (free and popular), **PrusaSlicer** (free), and **Orca Slicer**.

**3.4. Costs & Startup Investment**

*   **Machine Cost:**
    *   **Desktop FDM Printer:** $300 - $4,000. A professional-grade desktop printer suitable for a small business would be in the $1,000 - $4,000 range.
    *   **Industrial (SLS/PolyJet):** $50,000 - $500,000+. These are for large-scale production, not typically for a small startup.
*   **Material Cost:** Flexible TPU filament costs **$40 - $60 per kilogram**.
*   **Estimated Small Business Startup Cost:** A small design studio or prototyping business could be started for **$5,000 - $15,000**. This would cover:
    *   One or two high-quality desktop FDM printers.
    *   A variety of filament materials.
    *   A powerful computer for 3D modeling.
    *   Software licenses (though many free options exist).
