**Materials & Tools:**
*   **Wood:** Two pieces of live-edge wood (like walnut or olive wood).
*   **Resin:** Deep-pour epoxy resin.
*   **Pigment:** Mica powder or liquid resin dye in your chosen "river" color.
*   **Mold:** Melamine board and silicone caulk to build a leak-proof mold.
*   **Tools:** Sander (orbital or belt), polishing compound, heat gun or torch, mixing buckets, clamps, and optional router for flattening.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1.  **Prepare the Wood:** Ensure your wood pieces are flat and dry. Arrange them with the live edges facing each other to create the "river" channel.
2.  **Build the Mold:** Construct a box around your wood pieces using melamine board. The box should be slightly larger than your final tray dimensions. Seal all inside edges with silicone caulk and let it cure.
3.  **Secure the Wood:** Clamp the wood pieces down inside the mold. Wood will try to float on the epoxy, so this is essential.
4.  **Seal Coat:** Mix a small batch of clear epoxy and brush a thin "seal coat" onto all surfaces of the wood inside the mold. This prevents air bubbles from escaping the wood into your main pour. Let it get tacky (usually a few hours).
5.  **Mix and Pour the River:** Mix your deep-pour epoxy according to the manufacturer's instructions (measure by weight for accuracy). Stir in your pigment. Pour the resin slowly into the river channel.
6.  **Pop Bubbles:** Use a heat gun or torch to pop any air bubbles that rise to the surface. Pass the heat quickly over the surface; don't linger.
7.  **Cure:** Let the piece cure for the time specified by the manufacturer (often 24-72 hours) in a dust-free environment.
8.  **Demold and Flatten:** Remove the piece from the mold. If it's not perfectly flat, use a router with a flattening sled to level the surface.
9.  **Sand and Polish:** Sand the entire piece, starting with a low grit (like 80) and working your way up to a very high grit (2000 or more). For a glass-like finish on the resin, wet-sand the higher grits.
10. **Finish:** Apply a food-safe finish like mineral oil or a specialized wood butter. Attach handles if desired.

**Selling Point:** The uniqueness of the live-edge wood grain and the mesmerizing flow of the colored resin. Each piece is one-of-a-kind.
