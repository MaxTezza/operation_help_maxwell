# Cool Mods for the Classic Honda Rebel 250

The Honda Rebel 250 is a very popular bike for customization. Here is a summary of some of the most common and "cool" mods people do, broken down by category.

## Popular Custom Styles

*   **Bobber:** This is the most popular style for the Rebel. It involves stripping the bike down to a minimalist look. Common bobber mods include:
    *   Removing the front fender.
    *   "Chopping" or shortening the rear fender.
    *   Installing a solo spring seat.
    *   Changing to ape hangers or drag bars.
    *   Many people use bolt-on kits from places like Blue Collar Bobbers to achieve this look.

*   **Cafe Racer:** While less common due to the Rebel's cruiser frame, some people do convert them into a cafe racer style. This is a more challenging build that often requires significant custom fabrication, including:
    *   Installing clip-on or clubman handlebars.
    *   Using a flat cafe racer-style seat and tail.
    *   Modifying the suspension.

## Aesthetic & Ergonomic Mods

*   **Handlebars:** Swapping the stock handlebars is one of the most common mods to change the look and feel of the bike.
*   **Seat:** Custom seats are very popular, both for comfort and style.
*   **Fenders:** Shortening or removing the fenders is a hallmark of the bobber look.
*   **Lighting:** Upgrading to modern LED headlights, taillights, and turn signals is a popular way to update the bike's appearance and improve visibility.
*   **Mirrors:** Replacing the large stock mirrors with smaller, sleeker ones is a common and easy mod.

## Performance & Functional Mods

*   **Exhaust:** Many owners modify the exhaust for a better sound and a small performance boost. This can range from simply removing baffles to installing a full custom exhaust system.
*   **Carburetor Rejetting:** If you change the exhaust or air filter, you will likely need to rejet the carburetor to ensure the engine runs correctly.
*   **Air Filter:** Upgrading to a high-flow air filter is often done along with the exhaust.
*   **USB Charger & Phone Mount:** A practical modern upgrade for charging devices on the go.
*   **Louder Horn:** A common safety upgrade to make sure you are heard in traffic.
