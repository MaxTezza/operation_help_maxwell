# Forum Thread: MINI TURN SIGNALS -- REAR

**Discussion Starter:** BigJ (Nov 17, 2004)
Here is a mod to get rid of those oversize stock rear turn signals. They increase room for saddle bags, and look much better. They are simple to install, all it takes is a 7/16" drill bit (may be different depending on brand of signal). And someone who is not scared to drill through the fender. Make a cardboard patter of the side of the fender and cut out a hole where the signal will got, place pattern on fender and draw circle onto fender for placement, then do the other side the same way.

I am trying to clean up the looks of my v45 and am wanting to skinny the signal lights like this but I cant figure out how to do it just by looking at the pics here, so, any info would be greatly appreciated. I know I saw it somewhere on here but just cant seem to find it now. Help please. Thanx.

cTc drilled holes in the rear fender and mounted the lights there. Are fashioned 90 degree L brackets. Pretty straight-forward stuff.
