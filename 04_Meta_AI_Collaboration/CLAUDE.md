# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**operation_help_maxwell** is a documentation repository for motorcycle maintenance and modification notes, specifically focused on Honda Rebel motorcycles.

**Location**: `/home/mtez/operation_help_maxwell`

**Purpose**: Personal knowledge base for motorcycle resources, wiring diagrams, modification guides, and forum discussions.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - General project notes and overview
- `GEMINI.md` - Context file for Gemini AI collaboration
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file; context for Claude Code
- `motorcycle_resources.md` - Curated links to service manuals, wiring diagrams, and reference materials
- `honda_rebel_turn_signals.md` - Forum discussion and modification guide for aftermarket turn signals

## Working with this Repository

### Content Organization

This is a documentation-only repository with no code, build system, or tests. Files are markdown documents containing:
- External resource links (manuals, schematics, forums)
- Extracted forum discussions and community knowledge
- Modification guides and how-to information

### Adding New Content

When adding new documentation files:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `honda_rebel_turn_signals.md` not `mod1.md`)
- Include relevant metadata (source URLs, dates, model years)
- Preserve original formatting from forum posts or discussions where applicable
- Add references to new files in `README.md` if they represent major topics

### File Format Standards

- All files use GitHub-flavored Markdown
- External links should include context about what they contain
- Forum posts should preserve author names and dates when available
- Technical specifications (torque values, part numbers, etc.) should be clearly formatted

## Context Notes

- Primary motorcycle: 1985 Honda Rebel 250 (CMX250)
- Key resources are often behind Scribd paywalls (account may be required)
- This repository works alongside similar documentation maintained for Gemini AI (`GEMINI.md`)
