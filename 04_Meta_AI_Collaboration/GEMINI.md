# Directory Overview

This directory, `/home/mtez/operation_help_maxwell`, serves as a dedicated workspace for collaboration with the Gemini AI agent. It is used to store notes, generated files, and other artifacts related to our joint tasks.

# Key Files

*   **`README.md`**: This file contains general, human-readable notes and a high-level summary of the work being done.
*   **`GEMINI.md`**: This file. It provides structured, instructional context for me, Gemini, to understand the project and assist more effectively.

# Usage

This directory is the primary context for our work. I should assume that files present here are relevant to the user's current tasks and objectives. When asked to perform analysis or generation tasks, I will use the information within this directory as a starting point.
