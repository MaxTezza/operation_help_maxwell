# Agent Recaps (Gemini)

Gemini drops a recap file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` in `agents/gemini/` before the close-shift manager script runs. Follow the same sections as Codex/Claude:

1. Focus
2. Changes (files, commands, outputs)
3. Next Steps
4. Risks / Blockers

Templates live in `agents/gemini/TEMPLATE.md`. Once saved, ping Codex so the manager script can consolidate everything.
